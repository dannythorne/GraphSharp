# GraphSharp

Learning some C#/.NET by implementing a graph data structure with an eye
towards generalizing to a graph database datastructure.

Basic underlying adjacency structure, but each vertex and edge will have a node
with properties.

The edges are directed but can be traversed in either direction because they
are stored in the adjacency list for both the start vertex and the end vertex.
